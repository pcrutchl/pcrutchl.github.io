[{"content":" Hey, hiking is cool. I moved to Bellingham WA in March 2020 (great timing! ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·) and discovered pretty quickly that, hey, hiking is cool. I\u0026rsquo;m a creature of habit, though, and if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have something kicking me out of a rut I\u0026rsquo;d probably hike the same handful of trails over and over. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, almost every hiking trail around here is stunning, but some variety is nice.\nEnter the yearly Backcountry Essentials Trail Challenge. Every year in late April / early May this excellent local outdoors shop publishes a list of ten hiking trails on Instagram, and if you do eight of them before the end of September, you get entered in a giveaway for some gear. (I did eight last year just under the wire and picked up a pink double-wall mug that I use constantly.) The gear is really a bonus, though; the main benefit is (a) added motivation to get out consistently, (b) a list of sweet mostly-new-to-me trails to check out. (I think one last year was one I\u0026rsquo;d done before, none this year.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fun, motivates me to take a few pictures, and pushes me to get out and see new places. The trails are almost always stunning, and often less crowded than the North Cascades\u0026rsquo; greatest hits. Here\u0026rsquo;s 2022\u0026rsquo;s trail reports, in which I tried to get creative with layouts etc:\nFragrance Lake via Two Dollar Trail Baker Lake GPS track part 1 GPS track part 2 Chuckanut Ridge Trail GPS track Thunder Creek GPS track, descent only Park Butte GPS track, descent only Mt. Dickerman \u0026ndash; this one was ambitious (as anticipated) but very enjoyable GPS track, 3,898 ft of clumbing over 9.41 mi route as planned: 7.77 mi round trip 4,184 ft ascent 20.4% avg grade on ascent Still to come:\nYellow Aster Butte (route plan) 8.25 mi round trip 3,495 ft total ascent 13.6% avg grade on ascent, with a 16.5% grade Ã— 1.73 mi section out of the trailhead, and a 28.6% grade Ã— 0.25 mi scramble up to the false summit towards the end Chanterelle Trail \u0026ndash; technically, already did this one with the kid in a backpack, but didn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the lookout (route plan) 4.34 mi round trip 1,150 ft total ascent 9.4% avg grade on ascent Ptarmigan Ridge \u0026ndash; waiting for more snow to melt! (route plan) 9.84 mi round trip (as mapped, probably won\u0026rsquo;t go this far) 2,615 ft total ascent Up and down, but the longest ascent section is only a 9.7% avg grade Shannon Ridge (route plan) 7.06 mi round trip (as mapped, probably won\u0026rsquo;t go this far) 2,767 ft ascent 14.8% avg grade on ascent 2021 hikes are scattered around my IG profile.\n","date":"Aug 03 2022 09:37 -0700","permalink":"/posts/bce-trails-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hey, hiking is cool.","title":"BCE Trail Challenge 2022"},{"content":"","date":"Aug 03 2022 09:37 -0700","permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m a data scientist, dad, coffee enthusiast, budding hiker, and extremely poor skiier living in Bellingham, Washington, USA.
