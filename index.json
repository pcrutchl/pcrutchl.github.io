I moved to Bellingham WA in March 2020 (great timing! ðŸ¦ ðŸ˜·) and discovered pretty quickly that, hey, hiking is cool. I\u0026rsquo;m a creature of habit, though, and if I didn\u0026rsquo;t have something kicking me out of a rut I\u0026rsquo;d probably hike the same handful of trails over and over. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, almost every hiking trail around here is stunning, but some variety is nice.\nEnter the yearly Backcountry Essentials Trail Challenge. Every year in late April / early May this excellent local outdoors shop publishes a list of ten hiking trails on Instagram, and if you do eight of them before the end of September, you get entered in a giveaway for some gear. (I did eight last year just under the wire and picked up a pink double-wall mug that I use constantly.) The gear is really a bonus, though; the main benefit is (a) added motivation to get out consistently, (b) a list of sweet mostly-new-to-me trails to check out. (I think one last year was one I\u0026rsquo;d done before, none this year.)\nIt\u0026rsquo;s fun, motivates me to take a few pictures, and pushes me to get out and see new places. The trails are almost always stunning, and often less crowded than the North Cascades\u0026rsquo; greatest hits. Here\u0026rsquo;s 2022\u0026rsquo;s trail reports, in which I tried to get creative with layouts etc:\nFragrance Lake via Two Dollar Trail Baker Lake GPS track part 1 GPS track part 2 Chuckanut Ridge Trail GPS track Thunder Creek GPS track, descent only Park Butte GPS track, descent only Mt. Dickerman this one was ambitious (as anticipated), 3,898 ft of climbing over 9.41 mi, but very enjoyable GPS track route as planned: 7.77 mi round trip 4,184 ft ascent 20.4% avg grade on ascent Chanterelle Trail Accomplished with a 45-lb pack or so! Second bite at this one, since I already did most of it solo with the kid in a backpack, but didn\u0026rsquo;t make it all the way to the lookout. Having another adult to help entertain her was clutch this time. GPS track route as planned 4.34 mi round trip 1,150 ft total ascent 9.4% avg grade on ascent Shannon Ridge Last-minute solo hike for number 8 (though I\u0026rsquo;m hoping to get 1-2 more in this month) Ended up going farther than planned with a few more \u0026ldquo;Oh I wonder what\u0026rsquo;s around that ridge\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; extensions. On the track you can see that I accidentally left the trail looking (in vain) for a view\u0026hellip; GPS track route as planned: 7.06 mi round trip 2,767 ft ascent 14.8% avg grade on ascent Still to come:\nYellow Aster Butte (route plan) 8.25 mi round trip 3,495 ft total ascent 13.6% avg grade on ascent, with a 16.5% grade Ã— 1.73 mi section out of the trailhead, and a 28.6% grade Ã— 0.25 mi scramble up to the false summit towards the end Ptarmigan Ridge \u0026ndash; waiting for more snow to melt! (route plan) 9.84 mi round trip (as mapped, probably won\u0026rsquo;t go this far) 2,615 ft total ascent Up and down, but the longest ascent section is only a 9.7% avg grade 2021 hikes are scattered around my IG profile.\n","date":"Aug 03 2022 09:37 -0700","permalink":"/posts/bce-trails-2022/","section":"Posts","summary":"Hey, hiking is cool.","title":"BCE Trail Challenge 2022"},{"content":" I\u0026rsquo;m a data scientist and machine learning engineer, dad, coffee enthusiast, budding hiker, and extremely poor skiier living in Bellingham, Washington, USA.

I have made meaningful progress towards the broad goal of dashboarding \u0026ldquo;Is my child okay?\u0026rdquo; by delivering data products related to sleep and predicting \u0026ldquo;risk\u0026rdquo; related to network traffic temporal patterns and app categories.\nMy publication list can be found here.\nOutside of work, I like to experiment with espresso (longer post coming soon, videos available on my YouTube page), and Iâ€™ve taken up the de rigeur PNW outdoorsy activities of hiking (great!) and skiing (fun but hard! Iâ€™m awful!). Currently (Aug 2022) working my way through the BCE Trail Challenge 2022, and psyching myself up to figure out parallel turns on skis this winter.\nIcon by Bec Hurley ","date":"Jul 27 2022 12:45 -0700","permalink":"/about/","section":"Patrick Crutchley","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m a data scientist and machine learning engineer, dad, coffee enthusiast, budding hiker, and extremely poor skiier living in Bellingham, Washington, USA.","title":"About"},{"content":"After neglecting my web presence for way too long, supercres.net is in the process of being revamped using Hugo (and the Congo theme), hosted on Github Pages, with Github Actions to rebuild.
