After neglecting my web presence for way too long, supercres.net is revamped using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) (and the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme), hosted on Github Pages, with Github Actions to rebuild. I recommend the setup; I'm finding it way easier to edit in VSCode, commit, and push than to log into a CMS.
