After neglecting my web presence for way too long, supercres.net is in the process of being revamped using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) (and the [Congo](https://github.com/jpanther/congo) theme), hosted on Github Pages, with Github Actions to rebuild. I recommend the setup; I'm finding it way easier to edit in VSCode, commit, and push than to log into a CMS.

I just got really tired of finding a decent static-looking Wordpress template.

I'm also using this to disseminate more widely a portrait of myself I commissioned from [Bec Hurley](https://www.bechurley.com) [{{< icon "twitter" >}}](http://twitter.com/becpng)[{{< icon "instagram" >}}](http://instagram.com/bec.png) that I really like; highly recommended.

Naturally the site isn't even at its proper URL as I write this. It's being transferred from my old host now (whom I used for over 20 years!).
