Following a successful run of the [BCE Trail Challenge in 2022]({{< ref "/posts/bce-trails-2023" >}}), the 2023 hikes were [just posted](https://www.instagram.com/p/CspnkUvLM8u/), and I'm getting excited.

That's the [Backcountry Essentials](https://backcountryessentials.net) Trail Challenge. Every year in late April / early May this excellent local outdoors shop publishes a list of ten hiking trails on Instagram, and if you do eight of them before the end of September, you get entered in a giveaway for some gear.

The (remaining) hikes for this year are:

1. Sare's Head Trail (Sharpe Peak)
  - 2.1 miles, roundtrip
