I'm a data scientist, dad, coffee enthusiast, budding hiker, and extremely poor skiier living in Bellingham, Washington, USA.

I have a background in engineering ([Penn Bioengineering](https://be.seas.upenn.edu) BSE '07/MSE '17) and psychology, with academic research experience in [human memory](https://memory.psych.upenn.edu/Main_Page) and [social media, personality, and mental health](http://wwbp.org). I continued working on social media and mental health in industry at [Qntfy](https://qntfy.com), now part of [SonderMind](https://sondermind.com/), where I currently work on matching prospective clients to mental health providers.
